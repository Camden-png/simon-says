# Simon Says

## Synopsis:
This is a Discord bot minigame written in Python to simulate the childhood game of Simon says... but with a twist!  
Instead of touching your noise... you write words, descramble words, send emoticons, and more for points!  
By default, a new prompt occurs every hour. Enjoy!

* Optionally add more words to Random.txt to be selected from
